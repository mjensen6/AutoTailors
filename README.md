I am taking this snapshot just after installing the packages from Uniform... here's the link...

There is currently authorization for google, a working notes app, a few pages for implementing car stuff, and a prisma schema for makes models and market cars.

This morning I went to TFR and got half off my breakfast, but didn't look at the receipt before paying...oops... then the waitress told me she loves when I pay with my Apple card

Keep up the good work :)
